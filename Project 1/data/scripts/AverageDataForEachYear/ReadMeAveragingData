Two things:
The averaging of Precip, min and maxTemp takes very long. This is something we should look into and maybe accelerate.

For all parameters except SWE the script should be the same. We could change it from 7 scripts to two, just py passing the parameter we want to average and storing the foldernames somewhere with combination the parameter, but in my opinion redundant.
