You can use the one dataSet in Data/Climate/ FOlder to try to calculate the mean values faster. 
My version of doing it is in the "AverageParameters.ipynb" in the chapter "Average Parameters for all coordinates in coordinates.txt". 

You can download additional data with the "get-observations_PrecipTemp_old.py". It currently is set to download every 5th year, you would have to change that for each year.
